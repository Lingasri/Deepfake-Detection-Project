Title of the Project :

Deepfake Detection Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

About :

The Deepfake Detection Using CNN project aims to create a highly effective system to detect deepfake videos. Deepfakes are synthetic media where a person’s likeness or voice is convincingly altered using AI techniques. This manipulation can lead to misinformation and severe consequences. The project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture, to distinguish between real and fake video content. This system provides a reliable and scalable tool to combat the spread of false media content

The core functionality of the project allows users to upload videos, which are then processed by a CNN model to detect any alterations. The system provides real-time feedback on the authenticity of the video, reporting whether it is real or fake. The system is designed to handle large datasets and operates efficiently with an intuitive user interface for seamless interaction.

Features :

Deepfake Detection with CNN: Leveraging CNN, the system accurately distinguishes real videos from altered (deepfake) videos.
Real-Time Video Processing: The platform efficiently processes video uploads, delivering quick feedback on whether the content is genuine or manipulated.
Accuracy and Performance Reporting: Displays detailed accuracy metrics, including precision and recall, giving users a comprehensive understanding of the system's detection ability.
User-Friendly Interface: An intuitive UI allows users to upload videos, review results, and navigate previous analyses.
Secure Video and Data Storage: Ensures that user-uploaded videos and analysis results are stored securely, with attention to privacy and data protection.
History Tracking: Allows users to access past video detection results and track trends over time.

Requirements :

Operating System: 64-bit Windows 10 or Ubuntu for compatibility with machine learning frameworks.
Development Environment: Google Colab for training and testing the CNN models, facilitating scalable training with GPU resources.
Web Frameworks: React.js for the frontend, and Node.js/Express.js for the backend, ensuring a responsive and scalable web application.
Cloud Storage: MongoDB to securely store uploaded videos and their respective analysis history.
Multimedia Processing: ffmpeg for handling video uploads, frame extraction, and processing to prepare data for analysis.
Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow or Keras to build and train the CNN model, ensuring high-performance deepfake detection.
Version Control: Git for collaborative development and version control, maintaining a streamlined and efficient development process.
Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for writing, debugging, and managing the application codebase.

Process :

Dataset Loading in Colab: The system loads the real and fake video datasets into Google Colab from a connected source (e.g., Google Drive). The dataset contains a mix of genuine and deepfake videos, which are preprocessed and fed into the CNN for training.
Real and Fake Image Detection: Using the power of CNN, the model is trained to classify frames extracted from videos into two categories: real or fake. The model undergoes several training epochs to learn the distinguishing features of deepfake videos.
Model Training and Evaluation: The model is trained on a diverse dataset of real and deepfake images/videos using TensorFlow or Keras. It undergoes evaluation on test data, providing accuracy, loss, precision, and recall to ensure reliable performance.
Real-Time Feedback: Users can upload their own videos, which the system processes in real-time to detect whether they are genuine or manipulated. The system displays the prediction along with confidence scores to the user.

Results :

The Deepfake Detection Using CNN project successfully demonstrated the ability of Convolutional Neural Networks to distinguish between real and fake videos with high accuracy. The model was able to detect deepfakes with strong precision, providing reliable predictions on test data. Confidence scores generated by the model for each video allowed for transparent analysis, with the system confidently identifying fake videos and minimizing false positives. The overall performance of the model met the objectives, showing its capability in real-time video analysis and deepfake detection.

Impact :

The impact of this project is substantial in several areas:

Media Authenticity: The system provides a valuable tool for ensuring the authenticity of video content, helping to combat the spread of manipulated media across platforms.

Security: With its ability to detect fake videos, the model can be used to enhance security in online platforms, preventing the distribution of deceptive content and misinformation.

Public Trust: By offering a user-friendly interface and clear feedback on video authenticity, the project empowers individuals and organizations to assess the integrity of digital media, fostering greater trust in the information being shared.

Scalability: The model’s efficiency in processing large datasets ensures it can be scaled for use in various industries, including media, legal, and social platforms, where the detection of fake content is critical.
